# SMART-HOME-APPLIANCES
Abstract:
 Advancement of Automation technology, life is getting simpler and easier in all aspects. In todayâ€™s world Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. Internet of things is a growing network of everyday object-from industrial machine to consumer goods that can share information and complete tasks while you are busy with other activities. Wireless Home Automation system (WHAS) using IoT is a system that uses computers or mobile devices to control basic home functions and features automatically through internet from anywhere around the world.
 System Design:
The sensors connected to the microcontroller board are Smoke Detector, PIR, Ultrasonic and LDR sensor. Smoke detector is used to sense the Gas for leakage. If there is a leakage detected from the data sensed the alarm gets active.
The Ultrasonic sensors are used for automatic opening of doors if a person stands in front of them. The PIR-Passive infrared sensor is used for detection of human and turn ON the fan. The fan can also be controlled manually.
LDR is used for automatic light control in home if someone is in home at night the bulb is automatically turned ON and at day time it automatically turned OFF
